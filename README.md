# Repository manifest for Pelion Edge

This repository provides repository manifests to set up the Yocto build system for Pelion Edge. Please make all contributions against our development branch, `dev`. Merged changes will then be pulled into master.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).
- [build-essential](https://askubuntu.com/questions/398489/how-to-install-build-essential).
- Be sure your user is added to the Docker group.
- [repo](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading#installing-repo)
- As the recipes of various meta layers refer to git@github.com, it is essential your build machine's SSH key is saved in your GitHub account. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on how to generate SSH key and add to Github account.

## Quickstart

```
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ repo init -u ssh://git@github.com/armpelionedge/manifest-pelion-edge.git -b <branch>
$ repo sync -j8
$ cd build-env
$ cp <needed credentials>. #See Step 4 below for creation.
$ make
```

## Detailed steps

1. Install the repository.

   Download the `repo` tool:

   ```
   $ mkdir ~/bin
   $ PATH=~/bin:${PATH}
   $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
   $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
   ```
   Because the `repo` tool is built on top of Git, you must configure `user.name` and `user.email`:

   ```
   $ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
   $ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
   ```

1. Initialize a repository client:

   1. Create an empty directory to hold the build directory:

      ```
      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build
      ```

   1. Download the manifest in this repository:

      ```
      $ repo init -u ssh://git@github.com/armpelionedge/manifest-pelion-edge.git
      ```

   Your directory now contains a `.repo` directory.

1. Fetch all the repositories:

   ```
   $ repo sync -j8
   ```

1. Create and copy the [following certificates](https://github.com/armPelionEdge/meta-pelion-edge/blob/dev/BUILD.md#credentials-keys-and-certificates) to the `build-env` directory:

   1. `mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c` – Used to connect to your Pelion account. Create a developer certificate in the [Portal](https://portal.mbedcloud.com/) under **Device Identity** > **Certificates**, and download the C file.
   1. `Update_default_resources.c` – Used to authorize firmware updates to device and created by [initializing the manifest tool](https://github.com/ARMmbed/manifest-tool/blob/master/README.md#quick-start).

   The Make file puts these certificates in the correct spots for the build as long as they are in `build-env`.

1. Start the build with `make`:

   ```
   $ make
   ```

1. When it fails due to the private repository (mbedtls-psa / crypto), access the docker bash shell, and apply the following patch:

   ```
   $ make bash
   ```

   This gives you access to the bash shell in the docker build.

   1. Edit the following:

      ```
      $ vi poky/meta-pelion-edge/recipes-wigwag/mbed-edge-examples/mbed-edge-examples.bb
      ```

      1. Change the version: SRCREV = "0.9.0"
      1. Remove this file reference: file://0003-examples-0.8.0-should-use-mbed-edge-0.8.0.patch

   1. Edit the following:

      ```
      $ vi ~/poky/meta-pelion-edge/recipes-wigwag/mbed-edge-core/mbed-edge-core.inc
      ```

      1. Change the version: SRCREV = "0.9.0"
      1. Remove this file reference: file://0003-fix-compile-error-when-building-for-Release.patch

   1. Clean the state of the module with bitbake:

      ```
      $ source ~/poky/oe-init-build-env
      $ bitbake -c cleansstate mbed-edge-core-rpi3
      $ exit
      ```

1. After you return to your normal shell, you can complete the build by executing `make`:

   ```
   $ make
   ```

1. Flash your image:

   To flash console-image-raspberry3.wic:

   - To flash on macOS, use `dd`. This example assumes the SD card is enumerated as `/dev/diskX`, and you should verify your device's path:

      ```
      $ gunzip -c console-image-raspberrypi3.rootfs.wic.gz | sudo dd bs=4m of=/dev/diskX iflag=fullblock oflag=direct conv=fsync status=progress
      ```

      Note: To use on Windows, you can use the [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) application. (The UI is self explanatory: Choose the file to flash and the destination SD card, and then click **Flash**.) In some cases, using Etcher results in significant time savings over using `dd`.

   - To flash on Linux, use `dd`. You can use `lsblk` to find the name of your SD card block device:

      ```
      $ gunzip -c console-image-raspberrypi3.rootfs.wic.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/mmcblkX conv=sync
      ```

## Troubleshooting

Please see the `build-pelion-edge` [README](https://github.com/armpelionedge/build-pelion-edge/blob/master/README.md) for solutions to common build errors.
